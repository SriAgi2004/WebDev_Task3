The Book API is a simple RESTful API built with Express.js that allows users to manage a collection of books. It provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete book entries, making it ideal for learning and prototyping CRUD operations in a Node.js environment.

CRUD Operations: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a collection of books.

RESTful API Design: Follows REST principles with clear and consistent endpoint structures.

In-Memory Data Storage: Utilizes an in-memory array to store book data, eliminating the need for a database setup.

Express.js Framework: Built with Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications .

JSON Parsing Middleware: Incorporates middleware to parse JSON request bodies, facilitating easy data handling.

Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for scenarios like missing fields or non-existent book IDs.

Modular Code Structure: Organized codebase that separates concerns, making it easier to maintain and scale.

Extensibility: Designed to be easily extendable, allowing for integration with databases, authentication mechanisms, or frontend frameworks in the future.
